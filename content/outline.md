Here are the two final outlines in Markdown format.

### Topic 1: Backpacking Meal Preparation (Revised)

**Objective:** To prepare Scouts to select and pack their own meals, understand their mess kit requirements, and pack appropriate no-cook snacks and lunches.

**I. Introduction: Fuel for the Trail (5 minutes)**
* **The Goal:** Why backpacking food is different (weight, calories, preparation).
* **Key Principles:**
    1.  **Lightweight:** "Ounces equal pounds, and pounds equal pain."
    2.  **Calorie-Dense:** Maximize energy for the weight.
    3.  **Easy to Prepare:** Minimal steps, minimal fuel, minimal cleanup.
    4.  **No Refrigeration:** All foods must be shelf-stable and require no refrigeration.
    5.  **Leave No Trace (LNT):** All food, wrappers, and "micro-trash" must be packed out.

**II. Part 1: Hot Meals (Dinner/Breakfast) (10 minutes)**
* **What They Are:** Freeze-dried or dehydrated "boil-in-bag" meals (e.g., Mountain House, Backpacker's Pantry). These are shelf-stable and require no refrigeration.
* **Scout Responsibility:** You are purchasing your own hot meals:
    * **1 Dinner** (Saturday night)
    * **2 Breakfasts:**
        * **Saturday morning:** Freeze-dried/dehydrated breakfast meal (e.g., scrambled eggs, breakfast skillet).
        * **Sunday morning:** Simple breakfast like instant oatmeal packets (just add hot water).
    * Check if you are buying 1-person or 2-person servings.
    * **The "Meal Buddy" System:** If you plan to share a 2-person meal, you *must* coordinate with your buddy. This has a direct impact on your mess kit.
* **The Process (Demonstration):**
    1.  Show a sample meal pouch.
    2.  Explain the stove's role: The *only* job is to boil water. Troop provides Jet Boil backpacking stoves.
    3.  **Step-by-Step:** Boil water, pour into pouch, stir thoroughly (long spoon required), seal and wait.
    4.  **Eating:** You can eat directly from the pouch to minimize cleanup.
    5.  **Sunday Breakfast:** For oatmeal packets, simply pour boiling water into your insulated mug, stir, and enjoy.

**III. Part 2: Your Backpacking Mess Kit & Hydration (10 minutes)**
* **What is a "Mess Kit"?** For backpacking, it is the *absolute minimum* you need to eat and drink.
* **A Scout's Required Backpacking Mess Kit:**
    1.  **Item 1: A "Spork"** (Spoon/Fork combo) or a **long-handled spoon** (highly recommended for eating from a bag).
    2.  **Item 2: An Insulated Mug** (Plastic or metal). This is your "something to drink out of" for hot chocolate, a warm drink, or oatmeal. You'll also use this for your Sunday morning oatmeal breakfast.
    3.  **Item 3 (Conditional): A Lightweight Bowl or Plate.**
        * This is **ONLY REQUIRED** if you are sharing a 2-person meal with a "meal buddy."
        * One of the two buddies *must* bring a bowl so you can split the meal.
        * If you have your own 1-person meals, you *do not* need this item.
        * **Note:** If sharing a boil-in-bag meal with another Scout, one of you must bring a plastic plate or bowl for your half of the meal. Coordinate with your meal buddy!
* **What NOT to Bring:** Bulky car-camping mess kits, plates (unless sharing), multiple cups, or heavy metal silverware.
* **Hydration:**
    * **Requirement:** Capacity for at least 2 liters.
    * **Options:** Two 1-liter Nalgene-style bottles OR a 2-liter (or larger) hydration bladder/reservoir.

**IV. Part 3: Trail Food (Snack & Lunch) (10 minutes)**
* **Purpose:** These are your "on-the-move" calories. Both must be ready-to-eat, no-cook, no-refrigeration, and easily accessible (pack in a hip belt or outer pocket).
* **A. Mid-Morning Snack (Scout Responsibility):**
    * **Goal:** A quick, small energy boost.
    * **Examples (Bring 1-2):** Granola bar, energy bar, small bag of trail mix, beef jerky, fruit leather.
* **B. The "No-Cook" Trail Lunch (Scout Responsibility):**
    * **Goal:** A more substantial meal to eat on the trail.
    * **Packing:** Repackage *everything* from bulky boxes into zip-top bags.
    * **Examples (Build a meal):**
        * **The "Main":**
            * Tortillas or flatbread (crush-proof) with:
                * Foil packets (tuna, chicken, salmon).
                * Cured meats (pepperoni, hard salami).
                * Hard cheese (cheddar, provolone).
                * Peanut butter (squeeze tubes or individual cups) + jam/honey packets.
        * **The "Sides" (Add 1-2):**
            * Trail mix.
            * Protein or energy bars.
            * Dried fruit (apricots, apples).
            * Hard crackers (Triscuits, Wheat Thins - pack carefully to avoid crushing).

**V. Part 4: Cleanup, Hygiene, & Leave No Trace (5 minutes)**
* **Hygiene:** Use hand sanitizer before and after eating/cooking.
* **Cleaning Your Kit:**
    * The only items to clean are your spork, mug, and *bowl (if you brought one)*.
    * Use minimal water. Wipe clean with a small, dedicated camp towel. Do not use soap.
* **"Smellables":** All food, all trash (even wrappers), and scented items (like toothpaste) attract animals.
* **Packing Out:** Show a dedicated quart- or gallon-sized zip-top bag for *all* personal trash (wrappers, used meal pouches). This must all be packed out.
* **Storage:** All "smellables" will be stored at night in a "bear bag" as directed by adult leaders.

### Topic 2: Gear & Packing List (Raleigh Area - Fall)

**Objective:** To review the essential gear for a beginner backpacking trip, with a strong emphasis on staying warm and dry in cool, wet fall conditions.

**I. Introduction: Be Prepared, Not Over-Prepared (5 minutes)**
* **The Goal:** Carry *everything* you need to be safe and comfortable, and *nothing* you don't.
* **Backpack Basics:** Briefly show how to put on a pack and adjust the hip belt (hips carry the weight, not shoulders).

**II. Part 1: The "Big Three" (The Heaviest Items) (5 minutes)**
* **1. Backpack:** Your "house" on your back.
* **2. Shelter:** Tent (Scouts will share; distribute poles, stakes, and fly).
* **3. Sleep System:**
    * **Sleeping Bag:** Rated for the expected temperature (e.g., 20°F–30°F).
    * **Sleeping Pad:** *Critical for warmth.* This insulates you from the cold ground. (Foam or inflatable).

**III. Part 2: Clothing: The "No Cotton" Rule (10 minutes)**
* **Why No Cotton?** "Cotton Kills." It absorbs water (rain or sweat), loses all insulating value, and leads to hypothermia.
* **Use Synthetics or Wool:** Polyester, nylon, fleece, or wool.
* **The Layering System:**
    * **Base Layer:** Wicking (synthetic shirt, long underwear).
    * **Mid Layer:** Insulation (fleece jacket or puffy synthetic vest/jacket).
    * **Shell Layer:** Wind/Rain (Rain jacket AND rain pants).
* **Clothing List:**
    * **To Wear Hiking:**
        * 1 synthetic T-shirt (long or short sleeve).
        * 1 pair synthetic hiking pants or shorts.
        * 1 pair wool or synthetic socks.
        * Broken-in hiking boots or trail shoes.
    * **To Pack (in a waterproof bag):**
        * 1 *dedicated* set of sleep clothes (long underwear - top and bottom). *These must stay dry and are for sleeping only.*
        * 1 extra pair of wool/synthetic socks.
        * 1 warm insulating jacket (fleece/puffy).
        * 1 warm hat (beanie) and gloves.

**IV. Part 3: Essentials & Other Gear (10 minutes)**
* **The 10 Essentials (Backpacking Version):**
    1.  **Navigation:** (Covered by leaders for this trip).
    2.  **Headlamp:** + extra batteries. (Hands-free is better than a flashlight).
    3.  **Sun Protection:** Hat.
    4.  **First Aid:** Small personal kit (band-aids, blister care).
    5.  **Knife:** (Totin' Chip required).
    6.  **Fire:** (Covered by leaders).
    7.  **Shelter:** (Covered by tent).
    8.  **Extra Food:** 1 extra lunch or 2 extra energy bars.
    9.  **Extra Water:** Capacity for 2 liters (e.g., two 1-liter bottles).
    10. **Extra Clothes:** (Covered in clothing list).
* **Kitchen:**
    * Spork/Spoon.
    * Insulated mug (optional, for hot drinks).
* **Personal:**
    * Toothbrush (travel size), toothpaste (travel size).
    * Required personal medications (give to leaders).
    * Small camp towel.
* **Do NOT Bring:** Electronics, deodorant, axes/hatchets, cotton clothes, pillows.

**V. Part 4: How to Pack (Demonstration) (5 minutes)**
* **Key: Waterproofing.** Use a large trash compactor bag as a waterproof *liner* inside your backpack. Put all gear inside this bag.
* **Weight Distribution:**
    * **Bottom:** Bulky, "need-at-camp" items (Sleeping bag).
    * **Middle (Core):** Heaviest items (Food, stove) close to your back.
    * **Top:** "Need-first" items (Rain gear, first aid, toiletries).
    * **Pockets:** Snacks, headlamp, map.
* Compress everything. Cinch all straps tight so nothing dangles or swings.
