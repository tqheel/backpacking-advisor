This static website is a guide for the Scouts of 212 to follow as they prepare for the trip coming up on the weekend of Nov. 7 through 9 2025 at Camp Reeves near Carthage, NC.

The site will be hosted on Github pages for this repo, so a Github workflow is needed to publish changes upon commit to master branch.

## App Purpose
This interactive static website serves as a comprehensive guide for Scouts and their parents to understand the backpacking trip content, prepare effectively for the adventure, and access printable packing and meal planning checklists. The site provides an engaging, user-friendly interface that allows users to explore trip details, mark preparation items, and generate customized printable documents to ensure a well-prepared and safe outing.

## Recommended Tech Stack
To build this interactive static site, I recommend the following tech stack:

- **Framework**: Angular - A powerful JavaScript framework for building dynamic, interactive web applications that can be statically exported for hosting on GitHub Pages.
- **Frontend Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, and TypeScript (Angular's primary language) for core structure and interactivity.
- **Styling**: Angular Material or Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design that works well on mobile devices for parents and Scouts on the go.
- **Interactivity Features**: Angular components for features like collapsible sections, progress trackers for preparation, dynamic checklist generation, and reactive forms for trip planning.
- **Print Functionality**: CSS @media print queries to ensure checklists and planning documents print cleanly and legibly.
- **Build and Deployment**: Angular CLI for building the static site, and GitHub Actions workflow for automated building and deployment to GitHub Pages.

This stack ensures the site remains static (no server-side processing needed), is fast-loading, and provides the necessary interactivity for trip preparation while maintaining simplicity for maintenance and hosting.
